# Fraud Detection Model for Credit Card Transactions

The fraud in banking cards issue impacts in banks, sellers and customers alike. It's a tough competition between financial institutions and fraudsters where the former are currently developing new practices and regulations in order to avoid fraudulent payments. For example, the two factor authentication (SCA) for payments introduced by EU's PDS2 that pose obstacles on fraudsters when stealing card data. Another example pertains to real time fraud-checking through Machine Learning models that helps to identify the fraudulent payments patterns. Meanwhile, the latter are still looking for new ways to stole this data while thinking up new patterns that dodge these real time controls.

We choose this topic for our final project due to our interest in banking and the processes of fraud prevention in payments (most popular are anti money laundering and terrorism financing schemes). The train and test datasets found could satisfy our objetive within a two week deadline due to the end of the Data Science Bootcamp. 

The project structure is based on CRISP-DM methodology using its phases as the guide to explain the project and all the steps followed.

Our final project it's about [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection) competition in Kaggle where Vesta Corporation provided the dataset for this competition.__The nature of the project is a Kaggle competition so all the notebooks are Kaggle based.__ We highly recommend to look through the notebooks on Kaggle however we are uploading it in two more formats: Jupyter Notebook and Python script.

## Data

Due to the repository size limits, we can't upload full dataset on GitHub. 
Instead you can found all the data used on `Input` and `Output` section of each notebook.
